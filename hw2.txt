Question for B:
1) Why is version-control framework such as git important?
Version-control framework is important because when working in teams, it's crucial to be able to access all different kinds of versions of the project.

2) Explain the concept of branching in git
If you and a partner want to work on the same project in git, branching allows each person to make their own edits to later bring them back together and have a more polished original file. Without branching, any edits made on the original file would affect both coders and could cause confusion.
